## Reflection

### A 'Bit' About Me

Hey there, my name is Tucker Johnson and I'm a technology enthusiast with a keen interest in web development and virtual reality. I'm fascinated by the way these technologies are transforming the way we interact with one another and the world around us. Throughout my entire time in collage at the University of St. Thomas I made it a goal to learn and experiment with as much technology as possible which you will see outlined in my projects section below. My enjoyment in development has been a driving force behind my desire to become a software engineer or web developer. I am fully committed to pursuing this career path and am excited to see what my future holds. 

One project in particular that I am setting my emphasis on is the development of a community driven environment where users can share information regarding outdoor experiences and places throughout Minnesota. Although this project is currently in its early stages, its main goal is to allow individuals that either LOVE Minnesota or those who live in the state to safely be able to easily retrieve information that is relative to planning their next outdoor adventure. Eventually, the goal is to expand this project to accomodate user accounts, additional information, the ability to leave reviews/comments and the ability to share experiences and photos about specific locations throughout the state. At the end of the day, this application's main goal is to build a platform where outdoor enthusiasts can come together, talk and interact with one another about their Minnesota experiences. 

This project aims at providing a service that allows individuals thorughout the state to retrieve information in a safe and efficient matter for their next outdoor adventure. In the past, there have been many times where I have needed to gather information specific to where I want to explore in the state of Minnesota. This task is usually carried out by visiting multiple websites, some of which seemed sketchy in nature, to find the information needed. This application aims at reducing the weight of this task by allowing all this information to be found and shared from one website. This is the main goal of this application, but there is so much more that can be achieved including interactive capabilities (interactive map), blogs, adventure suggestions and so much more!

The link to the repository below titled "Minnesota Park and Campground Map Project" is the concept website for the core map functionality that will be integrated with the other features mentioned above that are still in development. The concept was developed using jQuery and Vue3, but the main platform will most likely be reengineered using React to accomodate scalability. Currently, the project integrates with a couple different API's, one being a weather API and another being a geodata API (address and Lat/Long Lookup). Please take a look at the readme in that project's repo to learn more.

## Projects


- [St. Paul Crime Data Restful API and UI](https://github.com/Tuck1297/St.-Paul-Crime-Project)

This project focused on creating a system that can efficiently filter thorugh and handle a massive amount of crime data maintained by the city of St. Paul in Minnesota. Utilizing a map and a table representing the crime data, a user can select an address related to a specific crime and be given an estimated location on the map that represens where the crime took place. There is also functionality allowing users to add and delete crimes from the database. This application was build using Node for the backend and Vue3 for the front-end. This project is a great example of how technology can be used to make data more accessible and easier to understand. 

- [Minnesota Park and Campground Map Project](https://github.com/Tuck1297/camping-map-app)

This project focused on creating a single-page application that through an interactive map users can easily look up specific information about any of Minnesota's State Parks, Recreation Areas, National Forests, Waysides, or campgrounds. Although in its earliest stages, this project aims to become a website that all outdoor enthusiasts in Minnesota can come visit to get the info they need for their next adventure. The front end work is done using Vue3 and the back end and hosting currently is managed by Firebase. This project is a perfect example of providing a easy way to find new outdoor experiences while eliminating hours of research. 

- [Personal Website](https://github.com/Tuck1297/tuck1297.github.io)

Being my first ever developed website, this project aims to share my abilities at using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a webpage telling you a bit about myself and my history. On this page you will find information pertaining to my Resume, Project history, a bit more about me. Other than the technology already mentioned, this project also utilizes Foundation to allow the webpage to be accessed and navigated through from any device. This project is a perfect, but simple example, of developing best practices in terms of web development accessible for all devices. 

- [Dynamic Paths Webserver - Sustainability](https://github.com/Tuck1297/dynamic-paths-sustainability)

This project focused on developing a dynamic paths website that models a specifc set of data. The data chosen to base the project around is focused on Sustainability and how analyzing such data can help organize and visualize the past and present to see what we as a society can change in the future. This project models renewable fuels (like biofuel and hydro-generated electricity) and their cooresponding consumption rates in the USA. Specifically, the data is organized by Sector (Residential, Industrial, etc...), State, and by Total consumption by year. Created using node, this project is a perfect example of creating a simple server side application to efficiently provide and display data based on the client's needs and wants. 

- [3D Projections - wireframe Rendering](https://github.com/Tuck1297/cg-3dprojections)

Focused on wireframe model rendering, this project utilizes matrices and arrays to simulate a high coding level implementation of what happens behind the hood in terms of generating graphics on a computer monitor. It utilizes the HTML5 Canvas API to render the wireframe models which are stored in json format either in a extenal file or embedded into the program. This project mainly helped understand the math concepts implemented and the work that the computer has to implement in order to display graphics on the monitor. 

- [Illumination Shading](https://github.com/Tuck1297/cg-illuminationshading-2)

Taking the next step after the 3D Projections project (see above), this project integrates lighting and textures. The name behind this project partially explains this process as there are two programs that communicate with the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) that allow the efficient rendering of lighting, colors and textures in a 3D virtual environment which are called shaders. This project mainly focused on developing these shaders to correctly implement the features of creating 3D objects in the environment, applying textures to those objects and adding light(s) to the environment to be able to see shapes and objects placed in the environment. This project emphasized the importance of the shaders and their purpose in generating interesting and complex virtual environments.

- [Interaction with Graphics - Creative Coding Final Project](https://github.com/Tuck1297/Creative-Coding-Final-Project-Code)

Creative coding is a concept where one moves away from creating a program for purposes of accomplishing a task. Instead it focuses on reflecting one's own perspective and thoughts through their code. This project aimed at accomplishing these tasks by building a interaction based project that allows one to take in and eventually interact with a virtual environment in a couple of different ways. They include through sight, sound and hand tracking. This project utilized a 3D JavaScript library called Three.js to accomplish the graphics while relying on a JS library called Handsfree.js for the hand tracking. If you have a moment this project is one that I would certainly recommend checking out. 

- [Interactive Experiment - Creative Coding Midterm Project](https://github.com/Tuck1297/InteractiveExperiment_CreativeCoding)

This project like the one above has a creative coding emphasis. It is one that has the same goals as the one above in terms of stimulating one's interaction with code. In particular, this project has a matrix like twist where you are being transported into the inner workings of a computer's operating system. There you will be able to interact with the "Binary code" and see it interact with some preloaded music chosen for this project. This project was implemented using a creative coding JavaScript library called P5.js. 

- [Kaleidoscope - Creative Coding](https://github.com/Tuck1297/CreativeCodingKaleidoscope)

This project utilizes a JavaScript library called P5.js to create a interactive embeddable web application that simulates a kaleidoscope like toy where the user can control spinning stars from moving inwards and outwards and their color. It makes for a very cool background generator!

- [Perlin Noise Fireworks - Creative Coding](https://github.com/Tuck1297/CreativeCodingFireworksPerlinNoise)

Like the Kaleidoscope project, this one uses P5.js to create a interactive embeddable web application. However, this one aims at using what is called Perlin Noise to create a firework like effect in the browser. Again, this can be a cool desktop background generator!
