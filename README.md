## Reflection

### A 'Bit' About Me

Hey there, my name is Tucker Johnson and I'm a technology enthusiast with a keen interest in web development and virtual reality. I'm fascinated by the way these technologies are transforming the way we interact with one another and the world around us. Throughout my entire time in collage at the University of St. Thomas I made it a goal to learn and experiment with as much technology as possible which you will see outlined in my projects section below. My enjoyment in development has been a driving force behind my desire to become a software engineer or web developer. I am fully committed to pursuing this career path and am excited to see what my future holds. 

One project in particular that I am setting my emphasis on is the development of a community driven environment where users can share information regarding outdoor experiences and places throughout Minnesota. Although this project is currently in its early stages, its main goal is to allow individuals that either LOVE Minnesota or those who live in the state to easily retrieve information that is relative to planning their next outdoor adventure. Eventually, the goal is to expand this project to accomodate user accounts, additional information, the ability to leave reviews/comments and the ability to share experiences and photos about specific locations throughout the state. At the end of the day, this application's main goal is to build a platform where outdoor enthusiasts can come together, talk and interact with one another about their Minnesota experiences. 

This project aims at providing a service that allows individuals thorughout the state to retrieve information in a safe and efficient matter for their next outdoor adventure. In the past, there have been many times where I have needed to gather information specific to where I want to explore in the state of Minnesota. This task is usually carried out by visiting multiple websites, some of which seemed sketchy in nature, to find the information needed. This application aims at reducing the weight of this task by allowing all this information to be found and shared from one website. This is the main goal of this application, but there is so much more that can be achieved including interactive capabilities (interactive map), blogs, adventure suggestions and so much more!

The link to the repository below titled "Minnesota Park and Campground Map Project" is the concept website for the core map functionality that will be integrated with the other features mentioned above that are still in development. The concept was developed using jQuery and Vue3, but the main platform will most likely be reengineered using React to accomodate scalability. Currently, the project integrates with a couple different API's, one being a weather API and another being a geodata API (address and Lat/Long Lookup). Please take a look at the readme in that project's repo to learn more.
